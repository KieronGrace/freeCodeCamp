        <h1>How CSS Works</h1>
      </header>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.</p>

        <h2>What is CSS</h2>
      </header>
      <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
      <p>A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
      <p><strong>Presenting</strong> a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>How does CSS affect HTML?</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A <strong>CSS rule</strong> is formed from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
        <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>
      <h3>A quick CSS example</h3>
        <p>The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element):</p>
        <pre><code>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
          &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
              &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
              &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:</p>
        <pre><code>
          h1 {
            color: blue;
            background-color: yellow;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }

          p {
            color: red;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p>The first rule starts with an <code>h1</code> selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is called a <strong>declaration</strong>):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
          <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
          <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The second rule starts with a <code>p</code> selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.</p>
        <p>In a web browser, the code above would produce the following output:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12537/first-example.png" alt="css example 01">
        <p>This isn't too pretty, but at least it starts to give you an idea of how CSS works.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>How does CSS actually work?</h2>
      </header>
      <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.</li>
        <li>The browser displays the contents of the DOM.</li>
      </ol>
      <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11781/rendering.svg" alt="parsing flow chart">
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM">
      <header>
        <h2>About the DOM</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
      <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.</p>
        <h3>DOM representation</h3>
        <p>Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's take an example to see how the DOM and CSS work together.</p>
        <p>Let's assume the following HTML code:</p>
        <pre><code>
          &lt;p&gt;
            Let's use:
            &lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the DOM, the node corresponding to our <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is a parent. Its children are a text node and the nodes corresponding to our <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. The SPAN nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their children:</p>
        <pre><code>
          P
          ├─ "Let's use:"
          ├─ SPAN
          |  └─ "Cascading"
          ├─ SPAN
          |  └─ "Style"
          └─ SPAN
             └─ "Sheets"
        </code></pre>
        <p>This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet —it renders the above DOM tree and then outputs it in the browser like so:</p>
