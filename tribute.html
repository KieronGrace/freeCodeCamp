      <p>This is Sadie. Sadie is a 15 year-old pure bred Pug. Sadie enjoys napping, barking at anything that moves, and watching Game of Thrones. Of course, Sadie was quite disapointed in the final season of GoT, but weren't we all? Sadie's favorite thing about Game of Thrones night is that she gets to share gummy bears with her humans while they all watch together. Since the series finale, Sadie has been focusing on her other loves. She has especially singled out the invader Tootsie as an outlet for her love of barking. Tootsie showed up in the house out of nowhere and seems to have charmed the humans. Sadie knows better, however, and will never cease in her quest to alert the humans of Tootsie's evil nature.</p>
